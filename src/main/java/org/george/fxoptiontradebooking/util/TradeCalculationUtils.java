/**
 * Utility class for financial calculations related to FX option trades.
 * 
 * This class provides methods for calculating various financial aspects of options trading,
 * including premium calculations, profit and loss (PnL) calculations, and potentially
 * other financial metrics relevant to FX option trading.
 * 
 * All calculations follow financial industry conventions for precision and rounding,

     * Calculates the premium amount for an FX option trade.
     * 
     * The premium is the price paid by the option buyer to the option seller,
     * typically calculated as a percentage (premium rate) of the notional amount.
     * 
     * This method implements a simple premium calculation:
     *   Premium = Notional Amount Ã— Premium Rate
     * 
     * The result is rounded to 2 decimal places using HALF_UP rounding,
     * following standard financial rounding conventions for monetary amounts.
     * 
     * @param notionalAmount The principal amount of the trade in the base currency
     * @param premiumRate The premium rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.02 for 2%)
     * @return The calculated premium amount, or ZERO if any input is null

     * 
     * This method provides a simplified PnL calculation for an option position
     * based on the difference between the current market rate and the strike price,
     * multiplied by the notional amount.
     * 
     * For a complete implementation, this would need to factor in:
     * - Option type (call/put) which determines profit direction
     * - Premium paid/received
     * - Whether the option is exercised or not
